  <p>I work in-person in the Seattle, WA area, and online anywhere you need me to be.</p>
    <p> This is my website. </p>

    <p>Soon there will be things here. Things like math things, and science things, and philosophical things. 
      I've been really interested lately in the ways we use math to make art and music---look for some 
      explorations of those topics here in the coming weeks!</p>
    <h3>Things that are be here</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://github.com/dcbaron/Epidemiology">Mathematical and computational models in epidemiology</a> (SIR, etc)</li>
	  <li>Population models</li>
	  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/dcbaron/HEPsim">multi-agent simulation</a> of the trading market for home equity positions, novel financial derivative thought up by the now-defunct <a href="angel.co/primarq">Primarq</a></li>
	  <li>My explorations of the theory behind machine learning, including a perceptron classifier, an SVM, simple neural networks, and more!</li>
	  <li>Cellular automata in Jupyter notebooks</li>
	  <li>My masters research: "<a href="https://github.com/dcbaron/fractal-astrobiology">Fractal Image Analysis and the Detection of Life</a>". A technique for detecting evidence of life on extrasolar planets (or, indeed, on any planet. I tested it on my classmates; they passed)</li>

	<h3>Constructing the 17-gon</h3>
    <img src="assets/17-petal-rose.png" width="200" height="200"></img>
    <p>
      <a href="assets/heptadecagon.pdf">A pdf slideshow</a>
      about straightedge-and-compass constructions, with a detailed demo of a 17-gon construction.
      Took me <i>ages</i> to code this in LaTeX, with all the TikZ graphics, and I have apparently lost the original .tex source. Sad day!
