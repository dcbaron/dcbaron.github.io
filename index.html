<h1>Math Things and Science Things and Other Things</h1>
  <h2>by Dan Baron</h2>
<p> This is my website. </p>

<p>Soon there will be things here. Things like math things, and science things, and philosophical things. Maybe some fiction. Probably mostly math things, though.</p>
<h3>Constructing the 17-gon</h3>
  <p><a href="heptadecagon.pdf">A pdf slideshow</a> about straightedge-and-compass constructions, with a detailed demo of a 17-gon construction. Took me <i>ages</i> to code this in LaTeX, with all the TikZ graphics, and I have apparently lost the original .tex source. Sad day!
