    <h1>Math Things and Science Things and Other Things</h1>
    <h2>by Dan Baron</h2>
    <p> This is my website. </p>

    <p>Soon there will be things here. Things like math things, and science things, and philosophical things. Maybe some fiction. Probably mostly math things, though.</p>
    <h3>Things that will be here</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="https://github.com/dcbaron/Epidemiology">Mathematical and computational models in epidemiology</a> (SIR, etc)</li>
	  <li>Population models</li>
	  <li>A <a href="https://github.com/dcbaron/HEPsim">multi-agent simulation</a> of the trading market for home equity positions, novel financial derivative thought up by the now-defunct <a href="angel.co/primarq">Primarq</a></li>
	  <li>My explorations of the theory behind machine learning, including a perceptron classifier, an SVM, simple neural networks, and more!</li>
	  <li>Cellular automata in Jupyter notebooks</li>
	  <li>My masters research: "<a href="https://github.com/dcbaron/fractal-astrobiology">Fractal Image Analysis and the Detection of Life</a>". A technique for detecting evidence of life on extrasolar planets (or, indeed, on any planet. I tested it on my classmates; they passed)</li>

	<h3>Constructing the 17-gon</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="assets/heptadecagon.pdf">A pdf slideshow</a>
      about straightedge-and-compass constructions, with a detailed demo of a 17-gon construction.
      Took me <i>ages</i> to code this in LaTeX, with all the TikZ graphics, and I have apparently lost the original .tex source. Sad day!
